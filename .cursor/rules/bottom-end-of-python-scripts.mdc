Bottom end of Python scripts

- Always end Python files with a runnable main guard:
  `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
- Below the guard, include minimal testing or demonstration code that exercises
  the functionality defined above (functions, classes, or script behavior).
- Keep tests concise and side-effect safe; prefer printing results or
  assertions that can run quickly.

Example:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simple demonstration / test
    result = add(2, 3)
    assert result == 5, f"Expected 5, got {result}"
    print("add(2, 3) ->", result)
```

Notes:

- Place this block at the very end of the file.
- Keep line lengths within 88 characters.

First lines in Python scripts

- Always start Python files with a module docstring on line 1.
- Immediately follow the docstring with a single `# %%` cell marker on the
  next line.
- Place all imports after that cell marker.

Example structure:

```python
"""Short description of this module.

Optional longer explanation that wraps at 88 characters.
"""

# %%
from __future__ import annotations

import sys
from pathlib import Path

# module code follows...
```

Notes:

- Keep the top-level docstring concise; wrap at 88 characters.
- Leave a single blank line between the docstring and `# %%` only if needed for
  readability, but prefer none.

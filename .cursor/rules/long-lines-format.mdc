Line length and long-strings formatting

- Always hard-wrap lines at a maximum of 88 characters. No exceptions.
- Apply to all source files and code blocks (Python, Markdown, YAML, TOML, JSON).
- Prefer parentheses for line continuations. Do not use backslashes (\\) for wrapping.

Python long strings: split using implicit concatenation inside parentheses

```python
text = (
    "summarise given text\nThe company reported an 8% rise in Q3 2024, driven by"
    " strong performance in the Asian market. Sales in this region have significantly"
    " contributed to the overall growth. Analysts attribute this success to strategic"
    " marketing and product localization. The positive trend in the Asian market is"
    " expected to continue into the next quarter."
)
```

F-strings: split into multiple f-strings within parentheses

```python
msg = (
    f"User {user_id} requested report for {year} "
    f"with filter {filter_name} and page size {page_size}"
)
```

Function calls, imports, and collections: break after `(` and one item per line

```python
result = some_function(
    very_long_argument_name_one,
    very_long_argument_name_two,
    option=True,
)

from package.subpackage import (
    alpha,
    beta,
    gamma,
)

items = [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
]
```

Comments and docstrings

- Wrap at 88 characters; reflow text to avoid exceeding the limit.
- Prefer links on their own line if they exceed the limit.
